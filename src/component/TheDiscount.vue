            <p>Thanks for shopping at Apple. We appreciate the fact that you like to buy the cool stuff we build. We also want to make sure you <br>
                have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re at the Apple <br>
                Online Store, in an Apple Retail Store, or on the phone with the Apple Contact Center. (To make it visually easier on both of us, <br>
                we’ll refer to these entities as the “Apple Store” in this policy.)</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions at an Apple Store. We’ll be as brief <br>
                as our attorneys will allow. The main thing to remember is that by placing an order or making a purchase at an Apple Store, you <br>
                agree to the terms set forth below along with Apple’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.</p>
